                                This is a simple token about a Jewish girl that won't pay the people who worked for her..
                                </p><p>
                                <a class=" text-zinc-800 transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:text-zinc-200 dark:hover:text-teal-500" href="https://drewroberts/.com">Drew Roberts</a> met <a class=" text-zinc-800 transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:text-zinc-200 dark:hover:text-teal-500" href="https://x.com/coopsnicoops">coops</a> and 3 of her frens Friday night at NFT.NYC and they were having a good time. They had previously spent hours talking in X Spaces, so it was kinda like meeting an old fren. coops said she wanted to launch a shitcoin, so Drew agreed and said they would use <a class=" text-zinc-800 transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:text-zinc-200 dark:hover:text-teal-500" href="https://github.com/roberts/standard">his contract standard</a> and he would waive his upfront dev fees.
                                </p><p>
                                There are typically $25,000 in upfront costs to launch a token which come back out of the tax revenue. The initial taxes with this smart contract structure are 3% buy and 16% sell split between 3 wallets equally on the buy tax and 6% to marketing, 6% to community, and 4% to developer on the sell tax. This aligns nicely so there is transparency in the budgeting for the project. This generates $35k in revenue to the marketing and community wallets and about $27,000 to the developer for every $1 million in volume. We were shooting for $2 million in volume then the taxes are reduced to a 3/3 for the remainder of the project and additional revenue is generated through the sell of NFTs to provide visual identity to the community.
                                </p><p>
                                The concept for coops coin was to create a token-gated fan club and generate excitement through a party at NFT.NYC that could use video footage and influencers to further promote the coin out to people in the fan club to spread the word and get more people to buy the tokens. Essentially, make it cool to be in the club and fun for everyone involved for the long-term. The marketing wallet was designed to be used for that, which is why we separated the tax structure in the contract.
                                </p><p>
                                In reality, this is what happened. We received $729k in volume at this tax structure generating $74,000 in revenue. The community wallet received $29k (8.64 ETH). There was an error in the code where the developer wallet didn't receive any of it and that percentage was sent to the marketing wallet, which received $45k (13.27 ETH). The marketing wallet should have received the same as the community wallet and the developer wallet was supposed to receive $16k (4.63 ETH). Both the community wallet and marketing wallet are in your control.
                                </p><p>
                                With this structure, the community wallet pays back the liquidity pool so it is owned by the community of the project and that's why we locked it for 18 months to the end of the Bull Run when we can stable coin it out if there remains a strong community. There was 2 ETH sent to the contract to fund the liquidity pool, so that should be paid back to Monster from that wallet. The remaining 6.64 ETH ($22,469) in that wallet go to compensate coops and the community.
                                </p><p>
                                The rest of the expenses are for marketing and developer fees which were combined into one wallet but should have been separated for transparency in budgeting and <a class=" text-zinc-800 transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:text-zinc-200 dark:hover:text-teal-500" href="https://github.com/roberts/standard/commit/ca46e3bec021b5267c121e6abe7598715d81ac7c">has already been corrected</a> in the contract for the next Drew Roberts project.
                                    </p><p>
                                It is best to separate those out to 8.64 ETH to project marketing and 4.63 ETH for the developer budget as it was setup in advance in the contract. That 4.63 ETH should be sent to the splitter set up for it in the contract, this divides the budget for creation / ongoing support of the website and the smart contract creation fees for this structure.
                                </p><p>
                                For the project marketing, we received 8.64 ETH during launch. For marketing, there were 4.7 ETH ($16,006) paid in advance from Joe and Drew. That should be paid back first. This leaves the remaining 3.94 ETH ($13,332) to sort out for paying people who were helping launch & market the project as that was the revenue they generated from the launch day. The ongoing tax revenue to this wallet is for ongoing marketing of the project. 
                                </p><p>
                                The marketing was setup to be managed by Matt but he was unavailable for launch and those decisions on launch day so we switched it right before launch <a class=" text-zinc-800 transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:text-zinc-200 dark:hover:text-teal-500" href="https://basescan.org/tx/0x29a3c7b6530f2a60f1a42c18e08a7b194f5f3a58be7d38b644e3c07e88656c8b">in this transaction</a> to coops which Drew wanted because it is a community project for her.
                                </p><p>
                                For the launch space and coordination, everyone was paid by the upfront expenses which I will break down for you. The only one who wasn't is Cashper who was to receive 0.85 ETH guaranteed upfront and 0.85 ETH on the backend depending on the success of the project. He hosted the Space and put it the hard work so he should receive that full amount if possible. The other people promised money on the backend from the launch should not receive it as they didn't deliver the $2m target volume on launch day. Taking the 1.7 ETH out, we are left with 2.2 ETH in the marketing wallet.
                                </p><p>
                                The party was cancelled when the project didn't generate the launch revenue we needed to deliver as extravagant of a party as planned. Yes, we could have done it cheaper, but we were operating under the assumption that we had that large of a budget. LOUDMOUTH was connected with Matt and asked to host the party. He also took the personal hit for it being cancelled when the budget fell short. He received $10,000 upfront to coordinate the party and pay for what we could but we committed to more that couldn't be recooped. Out of that, the most important is the remaining 1.1 ETH ($3k) to Rich Boy who flew to NYC and had the expenses for that trip coming out of what was promised to him. That leaves 1.1 ETH in the marketing wallet to be used for ongoing marketing of the project.
                                </p><p>
                                The marketing wallet has 13.27 ETH and 12.17 of it should be sent to a fresh wallet that I set up to transparently divide the expenses above. This leaves 1.1 ETH in the marketing wallet for you to use for a marketing budget and you will continue to receive marketing revenue through transaction volume.
                                </p><p>
                                The community wallet has 8.64 ETH and should send 2 ETH to Monster for the Liquidity Pool. This leaves 6.64 ETH for how you want to use it for your compensation and for the community.                         
                                </p>
